            <p>
                This is an easy pasta dish that makes use of any leftover
                veggies you may have on hand. You can increase, decrease,
                or sub out any veggies you wish. Some excellent additions 
                to this recipe would be bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, 
                zucchini, cauliflower--the possibilities are endless!
                Do be sure to allow this to chill for several hours 
                before serving.
                This allows the flavors to meld and really come together.
